## RUST-JOURNEY

Welcome to my Rust learning repository!  
This is where I document my step-by-step journey of learning the Rust programming language — from basics to advanced concepts.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Hands-on practice files and exercises
- Summaries of what I learn
- Small projects.
- Experiments with Rust features.

## Why I Started This

I'm learning Rust to prepare and master for blockchain development.

## Let’s GO!!

Stay tuned as I go from `fn main()` to mastering memory safety and concurrency in Rust.

Note: I'm a beginner in both **Rust** and **Git/GitHub**.

This repository is a learning space — so expect work-in-progress code, basic mistakes, and gradual improvements as I grow.

**Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!**
